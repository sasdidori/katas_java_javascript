  //generate a string -> always add the calculated pisano to the string
  //check the lastindexof 01 -> that's the pattern I have to look for and stop the generation if I've found it
  //last index of the generated string is bigger than 0 -> it must be bigger than 0, because 01 starts the pattern and 0 is on the 0th index
